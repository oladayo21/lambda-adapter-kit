# Contributing to lambda-adapter-kit

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (recommended: 22 LTS)
- pnpm (recommended package manager)
- Git

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lambda-adapter-kit.git
   cd lambda-adapter-kit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify setup:**
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code style
pnpm lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### Testing

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Run tests once
pnpm test:run

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Type check TypeScript
pnpm typecheck
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the library
pnpm build

# Build in watch mode
pnpm dev
```

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production branch
- `feature/your-feature` - Feature branches
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fix branches

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix  
- docs: documentation changes
- test: test changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- chore: build process or auxiliary tool changes
```

Examples:
```
feat(converter): add support for API Gateway v2 events
fix(handler): handle missing content-type header
docs: update README with new converter examples
test(converter): add tests for binary content detection
```

### Code Guidelines

#### Comments
- Add comments only where necessary to understand complex logic
- Focus on explaining "why" rather than "what"
- Document integration points and AWS Lambda specifics

#### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Add proper type annotations for public APIs
- Prefer interfaces over types for public APIs

#### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow existing test patterns

### Adding New Features

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Add tests** for your new functionality

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Run all checks:**
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm lint
   pnpm test:run
   pnpm build
   ```

6. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create pull request** on GitHub
